# Socket_Chat-Alchemy_Notes
This is my 1st project in Flask. <br/>
With help of Jinja2 I make some HTML pages, add ugly css, and some events in JS. <br/>
By client side I used SockeIO to connect to Flask.SocketIO server and write some JS to get use of it by frontend. <br/>
By server side I create DB server with SQLAlchemy, Flask app(or server...) and SockeIO server to make use of all needed functions. <br/>
<br/>
There are 5 important pages... Registation and Login, not really visible Logout an<br/> 
Notes: here every user can save thier own private notes <br/>
Chat: Working chat between users without reloading page.
